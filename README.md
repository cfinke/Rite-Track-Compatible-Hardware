Rite-Track-Compatible Hardware
==============================

3D models of a drawer component socket and case runner guide compatible with the Kenlin Rite-Trak drawer track system.

`Component Socket.skp` is an auto-conversion of the STL to SKP since I accidentally lost my original SketchUp file, so it won't be as easy to modify if you need to. Sorry.

Printing
========
The case runner should be printed with supports.

The socket is printed in two pieces to avoid requiring excessive support material. After printing, either use acetone to bond the two pieces back-to-back (if using ABS) or superglue for any other material.

Installation
============

Here's a video detailing the installation of the parts:
