Rite-Track-Compatible Hardware
==============================

3D models of a drawer component socket and case runner guide compatible with the Kenlin Rite-Trak drawer track system.

Printing
========
The case runner can be printed without supports if you printer can manage short overhangs.

The socket is printed in two pieces to avoid requiring support material. After printing, either use acetone to bond the two pieces back-to-back (if using ABS) or superglue for any other material.

Installation
============

Here's a video detailing the installation of the parts:
